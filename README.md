## Background
On my way to becoming a master programmer and financial analyst, I designed a program to analyze stock market data to help me decide which stocks to add to my portfolio.  In order to do this, I completed the following tasks:

## Analysis Methods
- Created a script to calculate the total volume each stock had over the year.
- Although past performance is not indicative of future results, I looked at the dollar and percent change in price over a year's time to track the performance of each stock.
 - For visual purposes, I have highlighted the positive changes with green and the negative changes with red.

Lastly, I provided a table that list the stock with the greatest % increase, greatest % increase, and the greatest total income.
